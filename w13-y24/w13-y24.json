I mean…it’s not like they had to invent anything.<br><br>How could it be that ‘jogging’ wasn’t something that, you know — just *was?<br><br>If you cannot sense, see, imagine, feel what could be, it's highly likely that it will not become a lived reality.<br><br>We celebrate dreamers, those who convince themselves of the possibility of their dreams despite the doubters.<br><br>In the imposed doubting lies the perspiration we often hear of — the hard work of translating the not true *yet into something you can point at and discuss, and hold, and turn on, and try, and ponder what the world would like if…<br><br>We celebrate dreamers because they do the hard work of translating the dream into reality, which then becomes the surprising and exciting, perhaps seasoned with skepticism. Onward the dream floats in this new stew of confusion as reality mingles with the dream poking and prodding it, checking to see if it is in fact worthy of occupying the reality of more than the dreamer.<br><br>Should the dream prove to be resonant enough to reveal its practical utility or for its resonance and ability to fill the various voids, gaps, and longings in our psyches, the dream becomes normal — no longer a dream but the thing that fills the gap between what was and the future.<br><br>If thinking and arranging your understanding of what is and what could be, or understanding the methods and techniques you need to appreciate how to see and sense the unanticipated and unexpected possibilities that we casually refer to as ‘the future’, then you should join the Near Future Laboratory, participate in our futuring and sense-making programs, platforms, and projects, and learn more about the ways we bring Imagination and Structure into rich, world-changing collaboration. Everything that will be once was the not true *yet. It’s Time to Imagine Harder. We’ve got some serious work to do.
