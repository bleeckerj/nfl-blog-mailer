You are one of 17,000 subscribers who appreciate the value of a futures-oriented mindset.<br>We found some artifacts from adjacent nows or alternative pasts. The future just happens to be the thing we anticipate but the kind of consciousness prepared to not predict but create has to luxuriate in the marvel of possibility, not just prognostication. When someone is reluctant to accept the possibility that the trajectory of human creativity is or is not going to obtain some stated objective that is so well-indoctrinated in the milieu of futures topics, I remind them that for some reason wheels on luggage didn't happen just because we had wheels and we had luggage. Or that 'jogging' used to not be 'a thing'.<br>Both took the efforts of human persistence and an ability to dream where the milieu at the moment was simply unable to see the possibility.<br>This is what we do here at Near Future Laboratory. We Imagine Harder, living with the unusual, the skeptical, the eclectic, the other possibilities and alternatives. Join us.<br><br><strong>My thesis is that the work we do is not a zero-sum game. We work with individuals, organizations, big brands, and educational institutions to reignite an appreciation of our existentially vital capability to Imagine possibility.</strong><br><br>Our purpose is to unlock your potential to make sense of and find value in creative practices and bring about meaningful, tangible change. Call that 'innovation', if you like.<br><br>We seek others ‚Äî individuals, institutions, brands, companies ‚Äî who want to collaborate, coordinate, and amplify this goal.<br><br>You can help by supporting this work.<br><br>How?

The rich complexity of this episteme of 'androids' and their electronic psyches are things of curiosity and complexity.
