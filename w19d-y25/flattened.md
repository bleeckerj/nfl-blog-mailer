It was Week 19 of 2025 and this guy came to his own murder trial?

I had a conversation with a friend recently about this idea of ‘Digital
Twins’.  
We were discussing how AI is changing the landscape of work and careers
and so forth. The usual stuff.  
The question came up about the somewhat bland implications of a Digital
Twin: handle my email; sort out my calendar; help me compose an email to
the team; maybe have some opinions about how to handle an interpersonal
challenge; maybe proxy for my interests at a town council meeting. That
sort of thing.  
But then we started wondering beyond these typical 'wheels-on-luggage'
sorts of things.  
What if a Digital Twin could be more than just a digital assistant? In
fact — what do we even mean by a Digital Twin? Let’s start with that.  
And then in the midst of this chat, I stumbled into this New York Times
article about how a Digital Twin showed up at its own murder trial.👇🏽

# This ‘digital twin’ had his day in court

Christopher Pelkey [showed
up](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/ai-victim-impact-statement-manslaughter.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare&sgrp=c&pvid=198D2ACE-4D3F-4408-B171-4735F1A19755)
at the court case adjudicating his murder, two years ago.  
His surviving sister conjured his presence, calling on a colleague to
put together an AI-likeness of Pelkey to make a victim’s statement at
the sentencing hearing of the man who murdered him.  
When we think about Digital Twins we often chase our imagination
straight to the agent that’ll manage our email, our bills, our
calendar.  
You know. The normal, ordinary, everyday boring stuff.  
Did you ever, \*ever imagine that a digital facsimile would do this?  
Speaking of Digital Twins — and whatever you \*think that might mean —
I’m hosting a General Seminar *this Monday and Wednesday* to discuss
what they might be, what we might \*want them to be, and imagining a
world in which they are as weird as wheels on luggage and avocado on
toast.  
Don’t miss out on General Seminar this Monday and Wednesday when we’ll
imagine into a world using Design Fiction wandering around finding
things like their

Are companion intelligences — the artificial kind, I mean — destined to
have warning labels like a pack of smokes? Is this the FDAA thing
[we worked on for
ADM](https://nearfuturelaboratory.com/projects/en/adm-future-foods/)
back a couple of years ago? “The Food, Drug & Algorithm Administration
(FDAA) is a fictional government agency that is responsible for the
regulation of algorithms in the same way that the FDA regulates food and
drugs. The FDAA is a speculative design fiction artifact that is
intended to provoke thought and discussion about the potential future of
algorithm regulation and the implications of algorithmic decision-making
on society.” Well here, with input from a Stanford lab, Common Sense
Media concludes the AI systems can exacerbate problems like addiction
and self harm. So..yeah. That's really not a surprise. Top line: Kids
should avoid AI companion bots—under force of law, this assessment says.

Magazine as Foresight Artifact</a> ➜</span>

What if our thoughts aren’t private? What if mobile phones vanished from
public spaces?  
[Sitra created this magazine from the
future](https://www.sttinfo.fi/tiedote/71139621/a-magazine-from-2046-a-glimpse-into-possible-futures?publisherId=1898&lang=en)
that reminds those of us who work at the intersection of now and next of
the power of the diegetic prototype to augment foresight.  
I’m not about chasing predictions; I’m after something far more profound
– the sense of change, the visceral feeling of what’s coming. That’s
where ‘diegetic prototypes’ come in: they allow us to inhabit futures
without forecasting them.  
At Near Future Laboratory, we want to work with you to translate trends
into these experiential glimpses, augmenting your foresight with deeper
sense of the possibilities of change leading to more effective
communications and deeper understandings of possibilities.  
The ‘magazine from the future’ is a remarkably vivid diegetic prototype
and a unique way to capture the analytic aspects of foresight. It’s a
way of translating scenarios into this form provides a powerful
augmentation to otherwise stiff analysis.  
Want to talk about how we translate trends and foresight into an
artifact like this? Check out our

I’ve been watching how more and more organizations begin to employ this
kind of fictioning to investigate a particular mode of futuring that is
meant to either augment the trad stuff — like the analytic foresight
approach.  
Readers here will note that the preference here at Near Future
Laboratory is experiential and artifact-based. Adjacent possibilities of
what-could-be — colloquially ‘Futures’ — that can be felt and
experienced as augmentations of the rational, analytic, structured
imposition of formal methods.  
Here we see an EU commission doing so (with our friends at NORMALS.) It
is quite encouraging that the EU is, as they put it, “Pioneering Policy
Innovation through Speculative Design”  

<div style="background-color: #f2f2f2; padding: 4px 5px; border-radius:0.8em;">

Set in the Symbiocene era of the 2050s, a time marked by an expanded
understanding of intelligence beyond human confines, Symbiotic explores
a revolutionary breakthrough. Scientists have created a device that
allows humans to experience the perceptions and sensory worlds of other
intelligent beings, immersing them in the 'umwelt' of these creatures.
This film documents the first groundbreaking experiences through the
device, capturing the profound experiences of those who ventured into
these new realms of intelligence.
