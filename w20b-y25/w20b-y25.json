Nor the kids who will inherit what we imagine today\n<br/>    \n5. They are the ones who will have to live in the worlds we dream (for them) today.\n<br/>\n6. Let me tell you why this doesn't help.\n<br/><br/>\n7. I used to ride mountain bikes.\n<br/>\n8. I was never very good at it.\n<br/>\n9. Partly because I never felt at home with the culture of it.\n<br/>\n10. But mostly because I didn’t want to break any bones.\n<br/>\n11. The best rule-of-thumb I learned to avoid breaking any bones was this — \n<br/>\n12. Never look at where you don’t want to end up.\n<br/>\n13. Stop looking at the danger.\n<br/>\n14. Stop looking at the bone breaker.\n<br/>\n15. Stop looking at where you don’t want to go.\n<br/>\n16. Look at where you do want to go.\n<br/>\n17. Same goes for futuring.\n<br/>\n18. Don’t imagine the world you don’t want to inhabit.\n<br/>\n19. Imagine the world you’d be okay with if your kids had to inhabit it.\n<br/>    \n20. Fewer dystopian futures, and more habitable ones.\n<br/>\n21. Want to know how I avoid imagining dark futures?\n<br/>\n22. How do you ‘stay with the trouble’ of a future in trouble, without causing more trouble?\n<br/>\n23. Why should we not shit-start by worldbuilding a future of armed conflict between the USA and Canada? Even — or especially — <a href='https://nearfuturelaboratory.com/blog/2025/05/the-trouble-with-staying-with-the-trouble-of-the-future/'>when done as an art project?\n<br/>\n24.
