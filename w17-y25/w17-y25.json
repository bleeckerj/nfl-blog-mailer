But it may be if I told you that the issues were from 1979 and 1981. And it starts one wondering: what kind of world would we be living in today if the AI from 45 years ago somehow, through some twist of technological counter-historical contingency, became ‘a thing’.\n<br/><br/>\n\nIn such a scenario, we would expect to see AI deeply intertwined with the aesthetics, cultural values, and technological aspects of that era, leading to a (possibly) very different trajectory in how machines interact with humans and shape society. \n<br/><br/>\n\nNow, before you antagonist start throwing around all manner of technical reasons for why this would be impossible, let me remind you that the meaning of AI is what we ascribe to it. And, n any case, imagine it's not me asking but, say, Neal Stephenson is asking you to help him imagine this adjacent timeline.\n<br/><br/>\n\nHere's how I'd set it up.\n<br/><br/>\n\nSay that, I dunno...someone at Cray Supercomputers back in the day was, like..“Hey...I got an idea! Suppose we create the CUDA architecture with this beast.”\n<br/><br/>\n\nAnd Seymour Cray was, like..“Oh wow. I'm not sure what you're talking about, but I feel like you're seem super excited and you've proven yourself to create some pretty interesting things so..you just might be on to something. Build your team! Take all the time you need. Let's see where you get!”\n<br/><br/>\n\nAnd then ‘it’ happens.\n<br/><br/>\n\nWhat is our world now when the sensibilities of the 1980s are poured into AI?\nSome like a Stephenson type character might write that story.\n<br/><br/>\nMe? I'm not so great at writing, but my dad was a newspaper man, so I told a version of this story in the form of a newspaper. ",
