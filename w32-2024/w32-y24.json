Design Fiction seeks to materialize imagined possibilities into artifacts that help us sense into, challenge, and expand our current understanding of the world.<br/><br/>Rolling around the meaning of all this has been a pastime that sometimes feels useful, sometimes feels avoidant. But let's say it is useful for a moment and continue to wonder what the heck is going on when we create a quirky artifact from a possible future and it feels <em>full</em> of all kinds of potential: a thing that seems like a not-so-bad commercial idea (hey! start a company again!) at the same time it feels like an ironic quirk that one laughs at because it's so...silly (cf 'Aspect' below).<br/><br/>I've felt this tension clear up a bit while on a shallow dive into the Metamodern stream.<br/><br/>Oh so briefly: Metamodernism names and describes a cultural, intellectual, and artistic movement that is characterized by a dynamic interplay between sincerity and irony, optimism and skepticism, hope and doubt. There's plenty you can discover <a href='https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/jac.v2i0.5677'>both as theory</a> and <a href='https://whatismetamodern.com/metamodernism-catalog/'>examples of what is metamodern</a>.<br/><br/>Theory mixes in the mind and fixes itself to whatever sense-making one might be doing at the moment, and at the moment I have been pondering ways of making Design Fiction make sense so as to make it work in the work that I happen to be working on.<br/><br/>I've learned that theory is not something one can hope to 'apply' as if it were a formula to solve a problem, but rather more like the tastes a gravy is able to augment, summons forth, and attach to flavors. In the context of what I'm wondering now, and as I read/listen/watch more on the Metamodern while also working on various DF projects, things come to mind that augment things that were barely legible such as that DF bridges the gap bewteen what is, what could and what should be/come. DF oscillates between the possible and the <em>not true *yet</em>, doing so to generate new ideas, provoke thought & discussion, and put one on the path to inspired action and innovation.<br/><br/>DF is not just things 'made up' or speculations — they are materialized probes and experiments. They are prototypes in the pragmatic 'engineering' sense of things.<br/><br/>(And I'll say it again, again: Design Fiction is not writing fiction about things. DF is an artifact that has come from a world, not a story about a world. There are other words for prose-based stories about worlds such as 'fiction', 'speculative fiction', 'science-fiction', etcetera. Why one would feel the need to rename these remarkable creative and well-established prose forms continues to elude me.)",

The workshop component will be a bit like the famous TBD Catalog Workshop where we looked into the future and described what we saw in the form of a product catalog.<br/><br/>This time we'll imagine the future of work — in the form of something like an 'employee handbook'. What are roles and responsibilities? Is 'employee' an archaic term in this future? How do we participate in the overall 'value creation' of the organization? Has what we today understand as a 'company' (which has its own rich history of evolution from previous forms of organizing human potential) now completely different in structure and meaning? It's a rich topic area and I can think of no better way to imagine into it than creating an artifact like this – and I want you to join us!",

            "main_copy" : "@pegaunisusicorn came across this weird app Aspect — a peculiar social media network(??) that consists solely of AI \"users\", with no real humans participating. I mean..except for you(?)<br/>Developed to address concerns about the prevalence of bots on traditional platforms, Aspect offers a simplified version of social media, where you engage exclusively with AI entities, which is another way of saying 'bot', I guess. It's got all of your familiar social media features like Instagram: you share photos and receive comments from AI-generated accounts. (Bots!) You can DM, and for your trouble you don't have to deal with normal humans.<br/>The app claims to enhance the user experience by eliminating the uncertainty of engaging with bots — you just know you're only engaging with bots. This may be for you if you feel like you get overlooked in conventional social media settings, as AI has the capacity to provide feedback without the delays associated with human engagement. They'll just like whatever you do like crazy.<br/>I almost feel professionally jealous of this little gizmo. It'd be a superlative piece of Design Fiction or a bit of software merch from an episode of \"Black Mirror.\" But, I think it's really real, which is different.",
