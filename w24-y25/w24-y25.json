Something everyone can relate to, even if we repress the truth of it all.<br/>\nWe are all aging.\n<br/>\nEvery day.\n<br/>\nIs longevity about living longer? About finding the way to extend biological life?\n<br/>\nSuppose it is not about length of life so much as fullness of purpose?\n<br/>\nWhat happens if we make aging about longevity rather than life extension?\n<br/>\nHow does the semantic shift adjust the way we design for more purposeful lives?\n<br/>\nCan we find the way to think of aging as a continuing path towards a sense of purpose and value?\n<br/>\nThese were our guiding sensibilities as we engaged a group of more than 50 participants in a 2-hour futuring workshop.\n<br/>\nThe vibe in the room was alive. You can sense the energy.<br/>\nIDEO folks who were not in the workshop were poking their heads around the corner to see where all the vibe was emanating from.<br/>\nThe engagement ran deep and thorough.\n<br/>\nPeople did not want to leave.\n<br/>\nAnd you all know what my KPIs are: <span style='border-radius: 4px; background-color: #e0f0ff; padding: 0 0.3em'>did people smile?
