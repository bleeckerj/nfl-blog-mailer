I think of prototypes as a way to make sense of an idea. They are a way to think through a problem, to explore possibilities, and to communicate ideas. They are a bridge between the abstract and the concrete, between thought and action.\n<br/><br/>3. Prototypes are a way to make ideas tangible, to give them form and substance. They are a way to test ideas, to see how they work in the real world, and to learn from the process of making.\n<br/><br/>4. Here at the Near Future Laboratory, every thing I do involves this kind of process of thinking-to-make.\n<br/><br/>5. If you want to know more about this, check out our work on the <a href='https://omata.com'>Omata One</a>, a cycling computer that we designed and built in 2014. It was a prototype that helped us think through the design and functionality of the product, and it ultimately led to the creation of a successful product.\n<br/><br/>6. It started with a simple idea: to create a cycling computer that was easy to use, accurate, and beautiful. I wanted to feel what it was like to create a product that effervesced the analog-mechanical feel of what it is to ride a bicycle, but did not require a smartphone, nor was over-indexed on the visual semantics of the already overclocked digital world.\n<br/><br/>7. ‚ÄùModern but also mechanical.‚Äù\n<br/><br/>8. If this approach to imagining through physical / digital / software / hardware prototypes resonates with you, <a href=‚Äòhttps://nearfuturelaboratory.com/contact'>get in touch</a>. I'm always looking to help organizations and teams catalyze their thinking, strategy, and product development through this kind of work. I am always looking for new projects and collaborations.<br/><br/>9. <a href='https://nearfuturelaboratory.com/blog/'>Read More about this topic on the blog ‚Üí</a>\n</div>"
