Instead of just reading a report, you experience a piece of the future. Like this newspaper that's come straight back to us from an AI-saturated world. It's not just imagined, but <em>materialized</em>. It's a slice of evidence from a possible future you can hold in your hands.\n</br>\nThis method? Design Fiction?<br/>\nIt works. It sparks richer conversations, clearer alignment, and more actionable strategies. These artifacts help organizations explore implications, tensions, and opportunities. And it does so viscerally, tangibly, not abstractly. You <em>feel into</em> possibilities in a way that has a rich, memetic quality.\n<br/>\nIf you're curious, <a href='https://shop.nearfuturelaboratory.com/products/applied-intelligence-issue-n-001'>grab a copy of the newspaper</a>.<br/>\nIf you're working through big questions about the future and need a creative partner, <a href='https://nearfuturelaboratory.com/contact'>let's talk</a>.","read_more_link_ref":"https://shop.nearfuturelaboratory.com/products/applied-intelligence-issue-n-001","subtitle":"Analysis of trends — in a newspaper from a possible future","title":"A Speculative AI Future","title_text_color":"#0a0a0a"}],"metadata":{"ordinal":"","template_name":"full-width-item.html"}}},{"spacer-30":{"elements":[{"background_color":"#FFFFFF","spacer_height":"20px"}],"metadata":{"ordinal":"","template_name":"spacer.html"}}},{"full-width-item-4":{"elements":[{"background_color":"#FFFFFF","border_bottom_left_radius":"0px","border_bottom_right_radius":"0px","border_color":"","border_top_left_radius":"0px","border_top_right_radius":"0px","border_width":"0px","image_url":"https://nearfuturelaboratory.com/images/design-fiction-dispatches/ai/dissonance-induced-cognitive-distortion/dissonance-induced-cognitive-distortion_4x5.jpg","link_ref":"https://nearfuturelaboratory.com/dispatches/ai/dissonance-induced-cognitive-distortion/","main_copy":"Speaking of Newspapers from an AI Future, this item appears — a pharmacological intervention to mitigate the thing many of us are probably feeling.<br/>\nAn artifact that implies mental health challenges introduced by AI, and the potential need for interventions in an increasingly AI-driven world.<br/>\nOf course, and to be clear, 'Dissonance Induced Cognitive Distortion' is a Design Fiction artifact meant to make implications, insights, ponderings, and the themes of things like <a href='https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/my-brain-finally-broke'>a New Yorker essay</a> into a curious, creative frame.<br/>\nIt is not in the DSM-IV..yet.<br/>\nYou can see the growing list of Design Fiction Dispatches from The Future over on the site.<br/>","read_more_link_ref":"https://nearfuturelaboratory.com/dispatches/ai/dissonance-induced-cognitive-distortion/","subtitle":"A New Design Fiction Dispatch from The Future","title":"Dissonance Induced Cognitive Distortion","title_text_color":"#0a0a0a"}],"metadata":{"ordinal":"","template_name":"full-width-item.html"}}},{"spacer-30":{"elements":[{"background_color":"#FFFFFF","spacer_height":"20px"}],"metadata":{"ordinal":"","template_name":"spacer.html"}}},{"simple-text-1":{"elements":[{"background_color":"#FFFFFF","bottom_left_radius":"0px","bottom_right_radius":"0px","font_size":"16px","line_height":"1em","main_html":"Thanks to all of my Patreon supporters!<br/><br/>\nPlease consider becoming a <a href='https://www.patreon.com/c/nearfuturelaboratory/membership'>Pro Plan patron</a> to help me continue doing all the things — this <a href='https://nearfuturelaboratory.com/newsletters/'>newsletter</a>, the <a href='https://nearfuturelaboratory.com/dispatches/'>Design Fiction Dispatches</a>, <a href='https://lu.ma/s47i5w9e'>Office Hours Side Projects</a>, and the <a href='https://nearfuturelaboratory.com/podcast'>Near Future Laboratory Podcast</a> (105 episodes! 9.07GB!).<br/><br/>\nAnd please share the newsletter with your friends, colleagues, and people with discretionary budgets.","text_color":"#0a0a0a","top_left_radius":"0px","top_right_radius":"0px"}],"metadata":{"ordinal":"","template_name":"simple-text.html"}}},{"bottom":{"elements":[{"build_time":"2025-06-25T09:49:44-07:00","build_year":"2025","file_name_no_extension":"w26b-y25"}],"metadata":{"ordinal":"","template_name":"bottom.html"}}}]
