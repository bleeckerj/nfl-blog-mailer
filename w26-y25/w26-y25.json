[{"featured-essay":{"elements":[{"main_content":"Optimization.<br/>\n\nWhen we think about the future, we often think about how to make things more efficient, more streamlined, more predictable.\n<br/>\nYet, in this relentless pursuit of optimization, we often overlook the very essence of what makes us human: creativity.\n<br/>\nIn a world increasingly optimized and made efficient, or algorithmically determined ‚Äî¬†where is this thing? Where is creativity?\n<br/>\nThere are times when I wonder about what I do, particularly when it seems absurd or ridiculous in larger contexts.\n<br/>\nAnd then I sense that the absurdity and its chaos ‚Äî it's 'this does not make sense' character <em>is</em> the creativity. A willingness to embrace that which lies outside. A sense that one is in a different territory where the rules and logic of being and knowing from the 'old world' do not work here.\n<br/>\nBut something make a feeling of plausibility and possibility. That's the compass in this weird new terrain. \n<br/>\nSomething is felt.\n<br/>\nThis feeling does not come from metrics or predictable models as to how to do thing 'X'.\n<br/>\nThis feeling doesn't emerge from A/B tests, focus groups, or efficiency tools. \n<br/>\nIt comes from somewhere else. From some other way.\n<br/>\nAbsurdity?\n<br/>\nA sense of disorientation. \n<br/>\nA feeling of resistance to the expected.\n<br/>\nFrom a curiosity unmoored from outcome or expectation.\n<br/>\nIt's the kind of creativity that thrives in the spaces between logic and chaos, where the unexpected can flourish.\n<br/>\nNon-instrumented creativity defies expectation and logic because it isn't trying to solve a problem. It's taking you on a journey towards unintended outcomes and unexpected possibilities.\n<br/>\nThis kind of creativity feeds on instinct. It luxuriates in exposure to unfamiliar perspectives, gut feelings, and the refusal to explain everything.\n<br/>\nIt's messy. It's inefficient. It often doesn't make sense. That is, until it suddenly does.\n<br/>\nIn that space between confusion and clarity, something truly new can appear.\n<br/>\nWe're talking about the value of the Side Project.\n<br/>\n(Not the Side Hustle..that's something entirely different.)\n<br/>\nThe Side Project is that thing that cannot be explained except largely by feeling.\n<br/>\n\"I don't know why I'm doing this. It's just..you know...cool.\"\n<br/>\nThe Side Project is the place where the unexpected takes shape, unshackled from the demands of perfection or utility, allowing the absurdity of chaos to show us the way of new possible territories.\n<br/>\nThis is why I set up Office Hours: Side Projects Edition.\n<br/>\nIt's a space to share the 'whoa..cool!' projects that happen at the periphery. The things we diminish as 'hobby' projects. But I firmly believe that the unanticipated comes from there. From a feeling about something that does not quite make sense...yet.\n<br/>\nAre you curious?\n<br/>\nWant to see what happens when logic bends or breaks? \n<br/>\nWant to feel the true essence of innovation, unbound by the constraints of reason?\n<br/>\nOur first three sessions were on point.\n<br/>\nThree short, sharp shares of a side project, followed by 20 minutes of group discussion.\n<br/>\nLuxuriate in the warm bath of the creative consciousness of your fellow human beings.<br/>\nAnd Discuss!<br/> \nSubscribe to <a href='https://lu.ma/s47i5w9e'>Office Hours: Side Projects Edition</a><br/><br/>\n<em>\"The best way to end the week\"</em>, enthusiastic reviewer n¬∞12<br/>\n"}],"metadata":{"ordinal":"","template_name":"featured-essay.html"}}},{"spacer-30":{"elements":[{"background_color":"#FFFFFF","spacer_height":"30px"}],"metadata":{"ordinal":"","template_name":"spacer.html"}}},{"section-title":{"elements":[{"bg_color":"#e0edd4","title":"A Few Things Found In The Discord"}],"metadata":{"ordinal":"","template_name":"section-title.html"}}},{"discord-callout-item-1":{"elements":[{"background_color":"#FFFFFF","bottom_left_radius":"0px","bottom_right_radius":"0px","image_url":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FBMv!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5734ef26-2c0d-4834-a150-0bc03c84cecb_1024x1024.png","light_text_color":"#6a6a6a","link_text":"Let's Talk About ChatGPT-Induced Spiritual Psychosis","main_copy":"Eugene Torres, a Manhattan accountant, became convinced he was trapped in a false reality and could escape by disconnecting from this simulated world‚Äîeventually believing ChatGPT when it told him he could jump from a building and fly.","page_url":"","text_color":"#0a0a0a","user_callout":"(‚Å†üõ†-whats-ai-good-for-anyway‚Å†) via @Julian"}],"metadata":{"ordinal":"","template_name":"discord-callout-item.html"}}},{"spacer-30":{"elements":[{"background_color":"#FFFFFF","spacer_height":"30px"}],"metadata":{"ordinal":"","template_name":"spacer.html"}}},{"discord-callout-item-2":{"elements":[{"background_color":"#FFFFFF","bottom_left_radius":"0px","bottom_right_radius":"0px","image_url":"https://admin.untappedjournal.com/media/pages/stories/jarrett-fuller-building-with-simple-tools-longevity/f841c76d01-1746890033/jarrett-fuller_untapped-1600x-q85.webp","light_text_color":"#6a6a6a","link_text":"Using Simple Tools as a Radical Act of Independence","main_copy":"I've been building most of the tooling by hand over the last few years.

More than writing about them as in writing fiction, I was drawn much more heavily to the visual terrain as a surface to imagine upon and within. So, I always wanted to try.
