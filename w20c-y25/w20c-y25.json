Particularly as the corporate foundation models make it increasingly apparent that they will always have a bias, likely towards the interests of their owners, whether that be a corporation or a government. The idea of having a model that is trained on your own data or the data of your community is appealing, and it raises questions about what it means to have a model that is truly representative of your own experiences and knowledge. This is particularly relevant in the context of the recent discussions around the biases present in large language models and the need more nominalist appreciations for what training data is and becomes. Like Grok going crazy every so often and slipping its moorings and going off on South Africa and white genocide, or Claude doing its Golden Gate Bridge thing.<br/>\nBut what does this mean in the context of, you know ‚Äî bedrock knowledge? What happens with the notion of 'common sense' when epistemologies are derived from a range or even infinity of knowledge bases?
