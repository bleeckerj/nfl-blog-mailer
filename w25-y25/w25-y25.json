Scouting ahead exploring, prototyping, speculating about opportunities ahead.<br/>\n\nThis is a moment for expansive speculation.<br/>\n\nThis new terrain is filled with dreams, dreads, hopes, and fears.<br/>\n\nIt feels like stories about frontiers.

They are compasses. Possible waypoints. Beacons, illuminating possible paths that help make sense of this new territory.<br/>\n\nIf you are not speculating in this way ‚Äî creating tangible artifacts of possibility ‚Äî then you are destined to inhabit someone else's dream of the future.<br/>\n\nIf you forge your own artifacts, if you step into the unknown with curiosity and courage, then you are doing the work of shaping what comes next.<br/>\n\nEmbrace the unknown.
