The workshop component will be a bit like the famous TBD Catalog Workshop where we looked into the future and described what we saw in the form of a product catalog.<br/><br/>This time we'll imagine the future of work ‚Äî in the form of something like an 'employee handbook'. What are roles and responsibilities? Is 'employee' an archaic term in this future? How do we participate in the overall 'value creation' of the organization? Has what we today understand as a 'company' (which has its own rich history of evolution from previous forms of organizing human potential) now completely different in structure and meaning?
